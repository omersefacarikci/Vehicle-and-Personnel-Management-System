This Personnel and Vehicle Tracking System, developed using C# and DevExpress, is designed to efficiently manage and monitor personnel and vehicle activities within an organization. The system leverages an Access database, which is included within the project directory, making it easy to set up and manage the necessary data.

To run this project successfully, several components need to be installed on your computer:

DevExpress: Required for the UI and additional functionalities.
Crystal Reports: Necessary for generating detailed reports within the system.
.NET Framework (latest version): Essential for ensuring all features of the software run smoothly.
These requirements are crucial to fully utilize the capabilities of the system and to maintain a seamless user experience.
